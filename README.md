# Auto Texter
A lightweight automation script written in Python and AppleScript that sends messages through iMessage on macOSâ€”designed for quick, repetitive dispatch in a local environment.

Note: this script will only work if you have a Mac

In `send.scpt` you'll find an applescript that tells your laptop to send a message through iMsg:
```
on run {targetPhoneNumber, targetMessageToSend}
    tell application "Messages"
        set targetService to 1st service whose service type = iMessage
        set targetBuddy to buddy targetPhoneNumber of targetService
        set targetMessage to targetMessageToSend
        send targetMessage to targetBuddy
    end tell
end run
```
Call this through `main.py`:
```
os.system('osascript send.scpt {} "{}"'.format(phone_number, message))
```

This tells your computer to run the defined applescript (given phone number and message). Allows us to send one word at a time with a for loop.
